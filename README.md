# Hide your messy background in webcam videos using Deep Learning
Using fastai to distinguish between foreground and background in webcam videos. Then blur the background using OpenCV.

I published this project on [my blog](https://deeplearning.berlin/fastai/privacy/getting%20started/2021/02/09/Background-Blur-Part-1.html), if you want to read the tutorial it's best to do so on my blog. To just run the code, you can download these notebooks however.
